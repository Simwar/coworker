## Deploy to Railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/coworker?referralCode=7FU369&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

One-click deploy of the Coworker server with Inngest, Postgres, Redis, and optional Tailscale private networking. After deploying, set your `MODEL` and API key (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) in the Railway service variables. See `.env.example` for all supported providers.

Download the [desktop app](https://github.com/Array-Ventures/coworker/releases) for macOS and point it at your Railway server URL.

## Self-Host

### Backend

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # add your API keys
bun install
bun run dev            # http://localhost:4111
```

### Desktop App

```bash
cd app && bun install && bun run dev
```

The app connects to `http://localhost:4111` by default. To connect to a remote server, go to **Settings > Advanced** and update the Server URL.

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

Builds are automated via GitHub Actions and pushed to `ghcr.io`.

## Google Workspace Integration

Coworker uses [gogcli](https://github.com/steipete/gogcli) to access Gmail, Calendar, and other Google services on behalf of the user. Setup requires a Google Cloud OAuth app.

### 1. Create a Google Cloud project

Go to [console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) and create a new project.

### 2. Enable APIs

Enable the APIs you want the agent to use (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, etc.) in the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).

### 3. Configure the OAuth consent screen

Go to [console.cloud.google.com/auth/branding](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/branding) and complete the consent screen setup.

### 4. Create OAuth credentials

Go to [console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients), click **Create Client**, select **Desktop app**, and download the JSON file.

### 5. Configure the agent

Set the following environment variables (or inputs when deploying on Astro):

```
GOG_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOG_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD=a-strong-password   # encrypts stored tokens at rest
```

Once set, users connect their Google account through the **Integrations** panel in the agent UI — no further server configuration needed.

## Auto-Updates

The desktop app supports automatic updates via GitHub Releases. When a new release is published, users are notified in **Settings > Advanced** where they can download and install the update.
